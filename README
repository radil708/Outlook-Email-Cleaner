############################# DESCRIPTION #############################
I made this program because I have emails filled with
ads and junk that got through my spam filter. It would take
too long to delete them all with the user interface on the web
or on the specific application so I decided to build a simple program
to delete emails that meet certain conditions. I am sharing it here
for others to use. If you decide to add on or modify this code
for yourself, all I ask is that you list me as a contributor or
provide some credit to me, thanks!

############################ PROJECT STATUS ############################
Status: In Progress

############################# REQUIREMENTS #############################
0.) System: Windows
1.) Python version :  3.6
2.) Third Party Python Modules: pywin32 (only works for windows systems)
     > You can install it via pip
3.) Application: Microsoft Outlook
4.) Signed in to outlook with the email of your choice(s)

NOTE(*** I understand that the third party modules and windows requirement
does limit this program. I may work on future version that works
across all systems and uses built in libraries to minimize
the requirements to run it)
